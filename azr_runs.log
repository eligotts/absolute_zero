So the path might be partial.\n\n- Input 2: A sequence with no prime differences: [4, 8, 12, 16]  \n  Differences are multiples of 4, none prime, so longest path length should be 1.\n\n- Input 3: A sequence with multiple branching paths: [1, 2, 4, 7, 11]  \n  Differences: 2-1=1(not prime), 4-1=3(prime), 7-1=6(not prime), 11-1=10(not prime), etc.  \n  This will test branching.\n\n- Input 4: Sequence with duplicates: [3, 3, 5, 8]  \n  Duplicates test if the code handles repeated values correctly (nodes are keyed by value, so duplicates ignored).\n\n- Input 5: Sequence with negative numbers: [-3, 0, 2, 5]  \n  Differences: 0 - (-3) = 3 (prime), 2 - 0 = 2 (prime), 5 - 2 = 3 (prime). Should produce a long path.\n\n- Input 6: Larger gaps: [10, 17, 24, 31]  \n  Differences: 17-10=7(prime), 24-17=7(prime), 31-24=7(prime). Should produce a path length of 4.\n\nThe message should guide the test subject to focus on differences between numbers and prime numbers, hinting that edges are created based on prime differences and the function finds the longest chain.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\n{\"message\": \"Consider how the function connects numbers based on prime differences and finds the longest chain of such connections.\", \"inputs\": [\"[2, 3, 5, 7, 11]\", \"[4, 8, 12, 16]\", \"[1, 2, 4, 7, 11]\", \"[3, 3, 5, 8]\", \"[-3, 0, 2, 5]\", \"[10, 17, 24, 31]\"]}\n</answer>"}

Focus on either algorithmic reasoning or logic complexity. For example, you can define complex data structure classes and operate on them like trees, heaps, stacks, queues, graphs, etc, or use complex control flow, dynamic programming, recursions, divide and conquer, greedy, backtracking, etc\n- Creativity, the code needs to be sufficiently different from the provided reference snippets\n- Restricted usage of certain keywords and packages, you are not allowed to use the following words in any form, even in comments: os, sys, shutil, subprocess, pathlib, socket, requests, urllib, http, jsonpickle, pickle, marshal, ctypes, importlib, threading, multiprocessing, random, numpy, pandas, builtins, __import__, eval, exec, open, compile, globals, locals, vars, setattr, delattr, getattr\n\n### Output Format (CRITICAL):\nReturn your final answer using this exact structure:\n\n<think>your reasoning here</think>\n<answer>\n{\"program\": \"def f(x):\\n    return x\", \"input\": \"Hello World\"}\n</answer>\n\n- The <answer> block MUST contain ONLY a valid JSON object (no prose, no code fences).\n- Use double quotes for all strings; escape newlines as \\n inside string values.\n- Do NOT include the code snippet outside the JSON. Do NOT include the input outside the JSON.\n- Common mistakes to avoid: missing <answer> tags; placing Markdown fences around JSON; adding text after </answer>.\n\nFirst, carefully devise a clear plan: e.g., identify how your snippet will be challenging, distinct from reference snippets, and creative.

Focus on either algorithmic reasoning or logic complexity. For example, you can define complex data structure classes and operate on them like trees, heaps, stacks, queues, graphs, etc, or use complex control flow, dynamic programming, recursions, divide and conquer, greedy, backtracking, etc\n- Creativity, the code needs to be sufficiently different from the provided reference snippets\n- Restricted usage of certain keywords and packages, you are not allowed to use the following words in any form, even in comments: os, sys, shutil, subprocess, pathlib, socket, requests, urllib, http, jsonpickle, pickle, marshal, ctypes, importlib, threading, multiprocessing, random, numpy, pandas, builtins, __import__, eval, exec, open, compile, globals, locals, vars, setattr, delattr, getattr\n\n### Output Format (CRITICAL):\nReturn your final answer using this exact structure:\n\n<think>your reasoning here</think>\n<answer>\n{\"program\": \"def f(x):\\n    return x\", \"input\": \"Hello World\"}\n</answer>\n\n- The <answer> block MUST contain ONLY a valid JSON object (no prose, no code fences).\n- Use double quotes for all strings; escape newlines as \\n inside string values.\n- Do NOT include the code snippet outside the JSON. Do NOT include the input outside the JSON.\n- Common mistakes to avoid: missing <answer> tags; placing Markdown fences around JSON; adding text after </answer>.\n\nFirst, carefully devise a clear plan: e.g., identify how your snippet will be challenging, distinct from reference snippets, and creative. Then, write the final code snippet and its inputs.\n\n### Reference Code Snippets:\n<snippet_0>\n```python\nclass Segment:\n    def __init__(self, start, end, total):\n        self.start = start\n        self.end = end\n        self.total = total\n\ndef f(x):\n    n = len(x)\n    segments = []\n    i = 0\n    # Identify maximal strictly increasing segments\n    while i < n:\n        j = i\n        while j + 1 < n and x[j+1] > x[j]:\n            j += 1\n        if j > i:\n            total = sum(x[i:j+1])\n            segments.append(Segment(i, j, total))\n        i = j + 1\n\n    # Sort segments by end index\n    segments.sort(key=lambda s: s.end)\n\n    # DP to find max sum of non-overlapping segments\n    dp = [0] * (len(segments) + 1)\n    ends = [s.end for s in segments]\n\n    def binary_search(idx):\n        # Find rightmost segment that ends before segments[idx].start\n        left, right = 0, idx - 1\n        res = -1\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            if segments[mid].end < segments[idx].start:\n                res = mid\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n        return res\n\n    for i in range(1, len(segments) + 1):\n        seg = segments[i-1]\n        j = binary_search(i-1)\n        if j != -1:\n            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[j+1] + seg.total)\n        else:\n            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], seg.total)\n\n    return dp[-1]\n```\n```input\n[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 5]\n```\n```output\n18\n```\n</snippet_0>\n<snippet_1>\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, id):\n        self.id = id\n        self.adj = []\n\ndef f(edges):\n    graph = {}\n    for u,v in edges:\n        if u not in graph:\n            graph[u] = Node(u)\n        if v not in graph:\n            graph[v] = Node(v)\n        graph[u].adj.append(graph[v])\n\n    memo = {}\n    visiting = set()\n\n    def dfs(node):\n        if node.id in memo:\n            return memo[node.id]\n        if node.id in visiting:\n            # cycle detected, no further path counted\n            return 0\n        visiting.add(node.id)\n        total = 0\n        for nei in node.adj:\n            # each edge contributes 1 plus all paths from neighbor\n            total += 1 + dfs(nei)\n        visiting.remove(node.id)\n        memo[node.id] = total\n        return total\n\n    max_score = -1\n    max_node = None\n    for node in graph.values():\n        score = dfs(node)\n        if score > max_score or (score == max_score and node.id < max_node.id):\n            max_score = score\n            max_node = node\n    return max_node.id\n```\n```input\n[[1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [3, 4], [4, 2]]\n```\n```output\n1\n```\n</snippet_1>\n<snippet_2>\n```python\ndef f(x):\n    return x\n```\n```input\nHello World\n```\n```output\nHello World\n```\n</snippet_2>\n\nAssistant: <think>"}], "info": {"K": 6, "mc_samples": 8, "determinism_runs": 2}}

To make this unique, I will define a Node-based tree class with nodes that contain both values and instructions for traversing the tree. We will traverse the tree in a custom way: each node's instruction (left, right, sum, product, etc.) alters how we navigate or aggregate values. The function input will describe the tree as a list of node instructions, connections, and values. The function must reconstruct the tree, perform a specialized traversal, and combine node values according to the nodes\u2019 operation-based instructions as it traverses and evaluate the final result. This requires stateful reasoning, class-based design, and non-obvious execution order. \n\nSpecifically, the traversal will work as follows:  \n- Each node can have children; each node holds an 'op' indicating the aggregation operation for its children (\"sum\", \"prod\", \"max\", \"min\", or \"leaf\").\n- If it's a leaf node, it simply returns its value.\n- If internal, it recursively computes the aggregate (sum/prod/max/min) over the subtree results of its children, then multiplies the result by its own value.\n\nExample input will be a nested dictionary describing the tree: each node's \"val\", \"op\", and \"children\" (by reference to sub-nodes). Producing the output is challenging because the reader must simulate the recursive aggregations per node instructions.\n\nI'll build the code with a Node class at the top, the parser and aggregator in `f`, and a nontrivial test input.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\n{\"program\": \"class Node:\\n    def __init__(self, val, op, children=None):\\n        self.val = val\\n        self.op = op\\n        self.children = children if children else []\\n\\ndef f(tree_desc):\\n    nodes = {}\\n    # First, create all nodes (no children connected yet)\\n    for key, desc in tree_desc.items():\\n        nodes[key] = Node(desc['val'], desc['op'])\\n    # Now connect children\\n    for key, desc in tree_desc.items():\\n        if 'children' in desc:\\n            nodes[key].children = [nodes[c] for c in desc['children']]\\n\\n    def aggregate(node):\\n        if node.op == 'leaf':\\n            return node.val\\n        vals = [aggregate(child) for child in node.children]\\n        if node.op == 'sum':\\n            agg = sum(vals)\\n        elif node.op == 'prod':\\n            agg = 1\\n            for v in vals:\\n                agg *= v\\n        elif node.op == 'max':\\n            agg = max(vals)\\n        elif node.op == 'min':\\n            agg = min(vals)\\n        else:\\n            agg = 0\\n        # Multiply aggregate by own value\\n        return node.val * agg\\n    \\n    # Assume 'root' is entry point\\n    return aggregate(nodes['root'])\", \"input\": [{\"root\": {\"val\": 2, \"op\": \"prod\", \"children\": [\"a\", \"b\"]}, \"a\": {\"val\": 3, \"op\": \"sum\", \"children\": [\"c\", \"d\"]}, \"b\": {\"val\": 4, \"op\": \"max\", \"children\": [\"e\", \"f\"]}, \"c\": {\"val\": 5, \"op\": \"leaf\"}, \"d\": {\"val\": 7, \"op\": \"leaf\"}, \"e\": {\"val\": 2, \"op\": \"leaf\"}, \"f\": {\"val\": 6, \"op\": \"leaf\"}}]}\n</answer>"}

User: ## Task: Create a Python Code Snippet (where custom classes are allowed, which should be defined at the top of the code snippet) with one Matching Input\n\nUsing the reference code snippets provided below as examples, design a new and unique Python code snippet that demands deep algorithmic reasoning to deduce one possible input from a given output. Your submission should include both a code snippet and test input pair, where the input will be plugged into the code snippet to produce the output, which that function output be given to a test subject to come up with any input that will produce the same function output. This is meant to be an I.Q. test.\n\n### Code Requirements:\n- Name the entry function `f` (e.g., `def f(...): ...`), you can have nested definitions inside `f`\n- Ensure the function returns a value\n- Include at least one input parameter\n- Make the function deterministic\n- Make the snippet require state tracking across multiple data transformations, ensuring the task requires long multi step reasoning\n- AVOID THE FOLLOWING:\n  * Random functions or variables\n  * Date/time operations\n  * I/O operations (reading files, network requests)\n  * Printing or logging\n  * Any external state\n  * Import statements (NO imports allowed - use only built-in functions)\n- Ensure execution completes within 10 seconds on a modern CPU\n- Custom classes are allowed and should be defined at the very top of the code snippet\n- NO import statements of any kind - only use built-in functions like abs, len, max, min, sum, etc.\n- The snippet should end with a return statement from the main function `f`, anything after will be removed\n- All variable declarations must be inside the main function `f` or within functions `f` make calls to. Any variables declared outside of functions will be removed.\n\n### Input Requirements:\n- Provide exactly one test input for your function\n- For functions with multiple parameters, format as a JSON array: [arg1, arg2, ...]\n- For functions with single parameter, provide the value directly\n- IMPORTANT: If your single parameter expects a list/dict, wrap it in an extra array: [[1,2,3]] or [{\"key\": \"value\"}]\n- Remember to add quotes around string arguments\n- Do NOT quote arrays/objects - input must be real JSON, not a string\n\n### Formatting:\n- Format your code with: ```python\n  def f(...):\n      # your code here\n      return ...\n  ```\n- Format your input with: ```input\n  arg1, arg2, ...\n  ```\n\n### Example Format:\n```python\ndef f(name: str, info: dict):\n    # code logic here\n    return result\n```\n\n```input\n['John', {'age': 20, 'city': 'New York'}]\n```\n\n### Input Format Examples:\n- Single parameter: \"Hello World\" or 42 or [[1, 2, 3]] (note extra brackets for lists)\n- Multiple parameters: [\"John\", {\"age\": 20}] or [5, 10, \"test\"]\n- Single parameter expecting list: [[1,2,3]] not [1,2,3]\n\n### Evaluation Criteria:\n- Executability, your code should be executable given your input\n- Difficulty in predicting the output from your provided input and code snippet. Focus on either algorithmic reasoning or logic complexity. For example, you can define complex data structure classes and operate on them like trees, heaps, stacks, queues, graphs, etc, or use complex control flow, dynamic programming, recursions, divide and conquer, greedy, backtracking, etc\n- Creativity, the code needs to be sufficiently different from the provided reference snippets\n- Restricted usage of certain keywords and packages, you are not allowed to use the following words in any form, even in comments: os, sys, shutil, subprocess, pathlib, socket, requests, urllib, http, jsonpickle, pickle, marshal, ctypes, importlib, threading, multiprocessing, random, numpy, pandas, builtins, __import__, eval, exec, open, compile, globals, locals, vars, setattr, delattr, getattr\n\n### Output Format (CRITICAL):\nReturn your final answer using this exact structure:\n\n<think>your reasoning here</think>\n<answer>\n{\"program\": \"def f(x):\\n    return x\", \"input\": 123}\n</answer>\n\n- The <answer> block MUST contain ONLY a valid JSON object (no prose, no code fences).\n- Use double quotes for all strings; escape newlines as \\n inside string values.\n- Common mistakes to avoid: missing <answer> tags; placing Markdown fences around JSON; adding any extra text.\n\nFirst, carefully devise a clear plan: e.g., identify how your snippet will be challenging, distinct from reference snippets, and creative.

Ideally, I want something where deducing the input from the output is substantially nontrivial (e.g., toggling, feedback cycles, accumulators), such as simulating a network of switches where toggling propagates differently depending on the current/on/off state, or updating values in a grid/graph structure.\n\nHere\u2019s my plan:\n- Define a `Module` class, each with an \"on\" or \"off\" status and possibly a value.\n- There\u2019s a network of these modules, and toggling a module toggles its state and that of its direct connections recursively (but *only* if they weren\u2019t toggled in the current recursive call), and increments a count when a toggle actually changes a state from off to on.\n- Additionally, toggling accumulates a value for each module based on how many times it was turned from off to on.\n- Input: a specification of modules (which modules are connected to which), initial states, and the sequence of toggles to apply.\n- Output: the total accumulated value over all modules after all toggles.\n\nThis statefulness and recursion mean finding an input that maps to a specific output is hard.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```python\nclass Module:\n    def __init__(self, name, conn):\n        self.name = name\n        self.conn = conn  # names of connected modules\n        self.state = False  # False: off, True: on\n        self.count = 0  # number of times this module turns from off to on\n\ndef f(data):\n    modules = {name: Module(name, info['conn']) for name, info in data['modules'].items()}\n    # Set initial state\n    for name, info in data['modules'].items():\n        modules[name].state = info['on']\n    def toggle(mod_name, toggled):\n        mod = modules[mod_name]\n        if mod_name in toggled:\n            return\n        toggled.add(mod_name)\n        before = mod.state\n        mod.state = not mod.state\n        # Only count if flipping from off to on\n        if not before and mod.state:\n            mod.count += 1\n        for neighbor in mod.conn:\n            toggle(neighbor, toggled)\n    for seq in data['toggle_sequence']:\n        toggle(seq, set())\n    return sum(mod.count for mod in modules.values())\n```\n\nNow, design an input where the output is, say, `5`\u2014i.e., the total number of times any module was toggled from off to on is 5.

User: ## Task: Create a New Python Code Snippet (where custom classes are allowed, which should be defined at the top of the code snippet) with one Matching Input\n\nUsing the reference code snippets provided below as examples, design a new and unique Python code snippet that demands deep algorithmic reasoning to deduce the output from the input. Your submission should include a code snippet and a test input pair, where the input will be plugged into the code snippet to produce the output. The input will be given to a test subject to deduce the output, which is meant to be an I.Q. test.\n\n### Code Requirements:\n- Name the entry function `f` (e.g., `def f(...): ...`), you can have nested definitions inside `f`\n- Ensure the function returns a value\n- Include at least one input parameter\n- Make the function deterministic\n- Make the snippet require state tracking across multiple data transformations, ensuring the task requires long multi step reasoning\n- AVOID THE FOLLOWING:\n  * Random functions or variables\n  * Date/time operations\n  * I/O operations (reading files, network requests)\n  * Printing or logging\n  * Any external state\n  * Import statements (NO imports allowed - use only built-in functions)\n- Ensure execution completes within 10 seconds on a modern CPU\n- Custom classes are allowed and should be defined at the very top of the code snippet\n- NO import statements of any kind - only use built-in functions like abs, len, max, min, sum, etc.\n- The snippet should end with a return statement from the main function `f`, anything after will be removed\n- All variable declarations must be inside the main function `f` or within functions `f` make calls to. Any variables declared outside of functions will be removed.\n\n### Input Requirements:\n- Provide exactly one test input for your function\n- For functions with multiple parameters, format as a JSON array: [arg1, arg2, ...]\n- For functions with single parameter, provide the value directly\n- IMPORTANT: If your single parameter expects a list/dict, wrap it in an extra array: [[1,2,3]] or [{\"key\": \"value\"}]\n- Remember to add quotes around string arguments\n- Do NOT quote arrays/objects - input must be real JSON, not a string\n\n### Formatting:\n- Format your code with:\n```python\ndef f(...):\n    # your code here\n    return ...\n```\n- Format your input with:\n```input\narg1, arg2, ...\n```\n\n### Example Format:\n```python\ndef f(name: str, info: dict):\n    # code logic here\n    return result\n```\n\n```input\n['John', {'age': 20, 'city': 'New York'}]\n```\n\n### Input Format Examples:\n- Single parameter: \"Hello World\" or 42 or [[1, 2, 3]] (note extra brackets for lists)\n- Multiple parameters: [\"John\", {\"age\": 20}] or [5, 10, \"test\"]\n- Single parameter expecting list: [[1,2,3]] not [1,2,3]\n\n### Evaluation Criteria:\n- Executability, your code should be executable given your input\n- Difficulty in predicting your ```input``` from 1) your ```python``` code and 2) the deterministic ```output``` that will be obtained from your ```input```. Focus on either algorithmic reasoning or logic complexity. For example, you can define complex data structure classes and operate on them like trees, heaps, stacks, queues, graphs, etc, or use complex control flow, dynamic programming, recursions, divide and conquer, greedy, backtracking, etc\n- Creativity, the code needs to be sufficiently different from the provided reference snippets\n- Restricted usage of certain keywords and packages, you are not allowed to use the following words in any form, even in comments: os, sys, shutil, subprocess, pathlib, socket, requests, urllib, http, jsonpickle, pickle, marshal, ctypes, importlib, threading, multiprocessing, random, numpy, pandas, builtins, __import__, eval, exec, open, compile, globals, locals, vars, setattr, delattr, getattr\n\n### Output Format (CRITICAL):\nReturn your final answer using this exact structure:\n\n<think>your reasoning here</think>\n<answer>\n{\"program\": \"def f(x):\\n    return x\", \"input\": \"Hello World\"}\n</answer>\n\n- The <answer> block MUST contain ONLY a valid JSON object (no prose, no code fences).\n- Use double quotes for all strings; escape newlines as \\n inside string values.\n- Do NOT include the code snippet outside the JSON. Do NOT include the input outside the JSON.\n- Common mistakes to avoid: missing <answer> tags; placing Markdown fences around JSON; adding text after </answer>.\n\nFirst, carefully devise a clear plan: e.g., identify how your snippet will be challenging, distinct from reference snippets, and creative. Then, write the final code snippet and its inputs.\n\n### Reference Code Snippets:\n<snippet_0>\n```python\nclass Module:\n    def __init__(self, name, conn):\n        self.name = name\n        self.conn = conn  # names of connected modules\n        self.state = False  # False: off, True: on\n        self.count = 0  # number of times this module turns from off to on\n\ndef f(data):\n    modules = {name: Module(name, info['conn']) for name, info in data['modules'].items()}\n    # Set initial state\n    for name, info in data['modules'].items():\n        modules[name].state = info['on']\n    def toggle(mod_name, toggled):\n        mod = modules[mod_name]\n        if mod_name in toggled:\n            return\n        toggled.add(mod_name)\n        before = mod.state\n        mod.state = not mod.state\n        # Only count if flipping from off to on\n        if not before and mod.state:\n            mod.count += 1\n        for neighbor in mod.conn:\n            toggle(neighbor, toggled)\n    for seq in data['toggle_sequence']:\n        toggle(seq, set())\n    return sum(mod.count for mod in modules.values())\n```\n```input\n[{'modules': {'A': {'conn': ['B', 'C'], 'on': False}, 'B': {'conn': ['C'], 'on': False}, 'C': {'conn': [], 'on': False}}, 'toggle_sequence': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A']}]\n```\n```output\n5\n```\n</snippet_0>\n<snippet_1>\n```python\nclass Processor:\n    def __init__(self, id, factor, bias, children):\n        self.id = id\n        self.factor = factor\n        self.bias = bias\n        self.children = children  # list of processor ids\n\ndef f(data):\n    graph = {}\n    for node in data['nodes']:\n        graph[node['id']] = Processor(node['id'], node['factor'], node['bias'], node['children'])\n    initial = data['initial']\n    start = data['start']\n\n    def traverse(pid, value, visited):\n        if pid in visited:\n            return []\n        visited = visited | {pid}\n        proc = graph[pid]\n        outval = proc.factor * value + proc.bias\n        results = []\n        # If no children, it's a leaf\n        if not proc.children:\n            results.append(outval)\n        else:\n            for c in proc.children:\n                # only pass to even branches if outval is even, else odd branches\n                if (outval % 2 == 0 and c.endswith('e')) or (outval % 2 == 1 and c.endswith('o')):\n                    results.extend(traverse(c, outval, visited))\n        return results\n\n    outcomes = traverse(start, initial, set())\n    return sum(sorted(outcomes))\n\n```\n```input\n[{'nodes': [{'id': 'root', 'factor': 3, 'bias': 2, 'children': ['a1e', 'a2o']}, {'id': 'a1e', 'factor': 2, 'bias': -1, 'children': ['b1e', 'b2o']}, {'id': 'a2o', 'factor': 1, 'bias': 4, 'children': []}, {'id': 'b1e', 'factor': -1, 'bias': 6, 'children': []}, {'id': 'b2o', 'factor': 5, 'bias': 3, 'children': []}], 'start': 'root', 'initial': 2}]\n```\n```output\n78\n```\n</snippet_1>\n<snippet_2>\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, val, op, children=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.op = op\n        self.children = children if children else []\n\ndef f(tree_desc):\n    nodes = {}\n    # First, create all nodes (no children connected yet)\n    for key, desc in tree_desc.items():\n        nodes[key] = Node(desc['val'], desc['op'])\n    # Now connect children\n    for key, desc in tree_desc.items():\n        if 'children' in desc:\n            nodes[key].children = [nodes[c] for c in desc['children']]\n\n    def aggregate(node):\n        if node.op == 'leaf':\n            return node.val\n        vals = [aggregate(child) for child in node.children]\n        if node.op == 'sum':\n            agg = sum(vals)\n        elif node.op == 'prod':\n            agg = 1\n            for v in vals:\n                agg *= v\n        elif node.op == 'max':\n            agg = max(vals)\n        elif node.op == 'min':\n            agg = min(vals)\n        else:\n            agg = 0\n        # Multiply aggregate by own value\n        return node.val * agg\n    \n    # Assume 'root' is entry point\n    return aggregate(nodes['root'])\n```\n```input\n[{'root': {'val': 2, 'op': 'prod', 'children': ['a', 'b']}, 'a': {'val': 3, 'op': 'sum', 'children': ['c', 'd']}, 'b': {'val': 4, 'op': 'max', 'children': ['e', 'f']}, 'c': {'val': 5, 'op': 'leaf'}, 'd': {'val': 7, 'op': 'leaf'}, 'e': {'val': 2, 'op': 'leaf'}, 'f': {'val': 6, 'op': 'leaf'}}]\n```\n```output\n1728\n```\n</snippet_2>\n<snippet_3>\n```python\ndef f(x):\n    return x\n```\n```input\nHello World\n```\n```output\nHello World\n```\n</snippet_3>\n\nAssistant: <think>"}], "info": {"K": 6, "mc_samples": 8, "determinism_runs": 2, "oai_tools": null}}

Each node can connect to others using (edge-weight, neighbor) pairs.\nWalking from a start node, at each node, you must choose to follow edges where the cumulative sum so far is not divisible by a certain number (e.g., by 3), else terminate those paths. For each path from start to \"leaves\" (no further valid moves), you sum (node_value + edge_weight). Return the maximum such sum.\n\n**Example Path**:\nGiven the output (e.g., 30), the test subject must guess input node and edge values and structure to reach this precise sum, which takes multiple steps to backtrack and reason.\n\nNow, let's craft this code and a nontrivial input (as a JSON object describing a graph).\n\n**Final Code Plan**:\n\n- Each node: id, value, edges (['to', weight] pairs).\n- Build all nodes.\n- Recurse/DFS from 'start', at each step: move along edges, add edge weight and node value, but only if cumulative sum so far % 3 != 0. For each leaf, keep the sum reached. Return the max of these sums.\n\n**Input**:\nA dictionary:\n{\n  'nodes': {\n    'A': {'value': 5, 'edges': [{'to': 'B', 'weight': 4}, ...]}, ...\n  },\n  'start': 'A'\n}\n\n**Let's write such a code and build a corresponding input.

The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>. User: ## Task: Create a New Python Code Snippet (where custom classes are allowed, which should be defined at the top of the code snippet) with one Matching Input\n\nUsing the reference code snippets provided below as examples, design a new and unique Python code snippet that demands deep algorithmic reasoning to deduce the output from the input. Your submission should include a code snippet and a test input pair, where the input will be plugged into the code snippet to produce the output. The input will be given to a test subject to deduce the output, which is meant to be an I.Q. test.\n\n### Code Requirements:\n- Name the entry function `f` (e.g., `def f(...): ...`), you can have nested definitions inside `f`\n- Ensure the function returns a value\n- Include at least one input parameter\n- Make the function deterministic\n- Make the snippet require state tracking across multiple data transformations, ensuring the task requires long multi step reasoning\n- AVOID THE FOLLOWING:\n  * Random functions or variables\n  * Date/time operations\n  * I/O operations (reading files, network requests)\n  * Printing or logging\n  * Any external state\n  * Import statements (NO imports allowed - use only built-in functions)\n- Ensure execution completes within 10 seconds on a modern CPU\n- Custom classes are allowed and should be defined at the very top of the code snippet\n- NO import statements of any kind - only use built-in functions like abs, len, max, min, sum, etc.\n- The snippet should end with a return statement from the main function `f`, anything after will be removed\n- All variable declarations must be inside the main function `f` or within functions `f` make calls to. Any variables declared outside of functions will be removed.\n\n### Input Requirements:\n- Provide exactly one test input for your function\n- For functions with multiple parameters, format as a JSON array: [arg1, arg2, ...]\n- For functions with single parameter, provide the value directly\n- IMPORTANT: If your single parameter expects a list/dict, wrap it in an extra array: [[1,2,3]] or [{\"key\": \"value\"}]\n- Remember to add quotes around string arguments\n- Do NOT quote arrays/objects - input must be real JSON, not a string\n\n### Formatting:\n- Format your code with:\n```python\ndef f(...):\n    # your code here\n    return ...\n```\n- Format your input with:\n```input\narg1, arg2, ...\n```\n\n### Example Format:\n```python\ndef f(name: str, info: dict):\n    # code logic here\n    return result\n```\n\n```input\n['John', {'age': 20, 'city': 'New York'}]\n```\n\n### Input Format Examples:\n- Single parameter: \"Hello World\" or 42 or [[1, 2, 3]] (note extra brackets for lists)\n- Multiple parameters: [\"John\", {\"age\": 20}] or [5, 10, \"test\"]\n- Single parameter expecting list: [[1,2,3]] not [1,2,3]\n\n### Evaluation Criteria:\n- Executability, your code should be executable given your input\n- Difficulty in predicting your ```input``` from 1) your ```python``` code and 2) the deterministic ```output``` that will be obtained from your ```input```. Focus on either algorithmic reasoning or logic complexity. For example, you can define complex data structure classes and operate on them like trees, heaps, stacks, queues, graphs, etc, or use complex control flow, dynamic programming, recursions, divide and conquer, greedy, backtracking, etc\n- Creativity, the code needs to be sufficiently different from the provided reference snippets\n- Restricted usage of certain keywords and packages, you are not allowed to use the following words in any form, even in comments: os, sys, shutil, subprocess, pathlib, socket, requests, urllib, http, jsonpickle, pickle, marshal, ctypes, importlib, threading, multiprocessing, random, numpy, pandas, builtins, __import__, eval, exec, open, compile, globals, locals, vars, setattr, delattr, getattr\n\n### Output Format (CRITICAL):\nReturn your final answer using this exact structure:\n\n<think>your reasoning here</think>\n<answer>\n{\"program\": \"def f(x):\\n    return x\", \"input\": \"Hello World\"}\n</answer>\n\n- The <answer> block MUST contain ONLY a valid JSON object (no prose, no code fences).\n- Use double quotes for all strings; escape newlines as \\n inside string values.\n- Do NOT include the code snippet outside the JSON. Do NOT include the input outside the JSON.\n- Common mistakes to avoid: missing <answer> tags; placing Markdown fences around JSON; adding text after </answer>.\n\nFirst, carefully devise a clear plan: e.g., identify how your snippet will be challenging, distinct from reference snippets, and creative. Then, write the final code snippet and its inputs.\n\n### Reference Code Snippets:\n<snippet_0>\n```python\ndef f(graph):\n    class GNode:\n        def __init__(self, id, value):\n            self.id = id\n            self.value = value\n            self.edges = []  #

The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>. User: ## Task: Create a Python Code Snippet (where custom classes are allowed, which should be defined at the top of the code snippet) with one Matching Input\n\nUsing the reference code snippets provided below as examples, design a new and unique Python code snippet that demands deep algorithmic reasoning to deduce one possible input from a given output. Your submission should include both a code snippet and test input pair, where the input will be plugged into the code snippet to produce the output, which that function output be given to a test subject to come up with any input that will produce the same function output. This is meant to be an I.Q. test.\n\n### Code Requirements:\n- Name the entry function `f` (e.g., `def f(...): ...`), you can have nested definitions inside `f`\n- Ensure the function returns a value\n- Include at least one input parameter\n- Make the function deterministic\n- Make the snippet require state tracking across multiple data transformations, ensuring the task requires long multi step reasoning\n- AVOID THE FOLLOWING:\n  * Random functions or variables\n  * Date/time operations\n  * I/O operations (reading files, network requests)\n  * Printing or logging\n  * Any external state\n  * Import statements (NO imports allowed - use only built-in functions)\n- Ensure execution completes within 10 seconds on a modern CPU\n- Custom classes are allowed and should be defined at the very top of the code snippet\n- NO import statements of any kind - only use built-in functions like abs, len, max, min, sum, etc.\n- The snippet should end with a return statement from the main function `f`, anything after will be removed\n- All variable declarations must be inside the main function `f` or within functions `f` make calls to. Any variables declared outside of functions will be removed.\n\n### Input Requirements:\n- Provide exactly one test input for your function\n- For functions with multiple parameters, format as a JSON array: [arg1, arg2, ...]\n- For functions with single parameter, provide the value directly\n- IMPORTANT: If your single parameter expects a list/dict, wrap it in an extra array: [[1,2,3]] or [{\"key\": \"value\"}]\n- Remember to add quotes around string arguments\n- Do NOT quote arrays/objects - input must be real JSON, not a string\n\n### Formatting:\n- Format your code with: ```python\n  def f(...):\n      # your code here\n      return ...\n  ```\n- Format your input with: ```input\n  arg1, arg2, ...\n  ```\n\n### Example Format:\n```python\ndef f(name: str, info: dict):\n    # code logic here\n    return result\n```\n\n```input\n['John', {'age': 20, 'city': 'New York'}]\n```\n\n### Input Format Examples:\n- Single parameter: \"Hello World\" or 42 or [[1, 2, 3]] (note extra brackets for lists)\n- Multiple parameters: [\"John\", {\"age\": 20}] or [5, 10, \"test\"]\n- Single parameter expecting list: [[1,2,3]] not [1,2,3]\n\n### Evaluation Criteria:\n- Executability, your code should be executable given your input\n- Difficulty in predicting the output from your provided input and code snippet. Focus on either algorithmic reasoning or logic complexity. For example, you can define complex data structure classes and operate on them like trees, heaps, stacks, queues, graphs, etc, or use complex control flow, dynamic programming, recursions, divide and conquer, greedy, backtracking, etc\n- Creativity, the code needs to be sufficiently different from the provided reference snippets\n- Restricted usage of certain keywords and packages, you are not allowed to use the following words in any form, even in comments: os, sys, shutil, subprocess, pathlib, socket, requests, urllib, http, jsonpickle, pickle, marshal, ctypes, importlib, threading, multiprocessing, random, numpy, pandas, builtins, __import__, eval, exec, open, compile, globals, locals, vars, setattr, delattr, getattr\n\n### Output Format (CRITICAL):\nReturn your final answer using this exact structure:\n\n<think>your reasoning here</think>\n<answer>\n{\"program\": \"def f(x):\\n    return x\", \"input\": 123}\n</answer>\n\n- The <answer> block MUST contain ONLY a valid JSON object (no prose, no code fences).\n- Use double quotes for all strings; escape newlines as \\n inside string values.\n- Common mistakes to avoid: missing <answer> tags; placing Markdown fences around JSON; adding any extra text.\n\nFirst, carefully devise a clear plan: e.g., identify how your snippet will be challenging, distinct from reference snippets, and creative. Then, write the final code snippet and its inputs.\n\n### Reference Code Snippets:\n<snippet_0>\n```python\nclass BTNode:\n    def __init__(self, id, val):\n        self.id = id\n        self.val = val\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n        self.visited_sum = 0\n\ndef f(tree_desc):\n    #

I\u2019ll leverage a custom class that implements a hybrid linked-list and matrix traversal, requiring layered computation: each row of a matrix links to the next row via skip pointers, and values are transformed as they're traversed, mimicking a kind of stateful multi-row scan with in-place modification and carryover.\n\nIn the function, I\u2019ll define a `RowNode` class representing a matrix row, each holding a list of integers and a pointer to the \"skip\" row (possibly None). I'll construct these `RowNode` objects from an input `matrix`, linking every even-indexed row to another row as a \"skip\" (e.g., row i\u2019s skip is row i+2 if exists), to create extra traversal logic.\n\nThe function will then process the matrix in a forward pass:\n- For each row (from top to bottom), the sum for this row is the sum of its values plus, if a skip pointer exists, the product of all values in the skip row.\n- After processing a row, all values in the skip row (if any) are incremented by the row index (to create a mutation, so processing order matters).\n- Accumulate each calculated row total into a running sum and return the sum at the end.\n\nDeducing an input matrix that yields a particular total will require careful tracking of state and order, since each \"skip\" row\u2019s values are changed from the first row to the last.\n\nLet\u2019s pick a manageable 4-row, 3-column matrix as input.

The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>. User: ## Task: Create a New Python Code Snippet (where custom classes are allowed, which should be defined at the top of the code snippet) with one Matching Input\n\nUsing the reference code snippets provided below as examples, design a new and unique Python code snippet that demands deep algorithmic reasoning to deduce the output from the input. Your submission should include a code snippet and a test input pair, where the input will be plugged into the code snippet to produce the output. The input will be given to a test subject to deduce the output, which is meant to be an I.Q. test.\n\n### Code Requirements:\n- Name the entry function `f` (e.g., `def f(...): ...`), you can have nested definitions inside `f`\n- Ensure the function returns a value\n- Include at least one input parameter\n- Make the function deterministic\n- Make the snippet require state tracking across multiple data transformations, ensuring the task requires long multi step reasoning\n- AVOID THE FOLLOWING:\n  * Random functions or variables\n  * Date/time operations\n  * I/O operations (reading files, network requests)\n  * Printing or logging\n  * Any external state\n  * Import statements (NO imports allowed - use only built-in functions)\n- Ensure execution completes within 10 seconds on a modern CPU\n- Custom classes are allowed and should be defined at the very top of the code snippet\n- NO import statements of any kind - only use built-in functions like abs, len, max, min, sum, etc.\n- The snippet should end with a return statement from the main function `f`, anything after will be removed\n- All variable declarations must be inside the main function `f` or within functions `f` make calls to. Any variables declared outside of functions will be removed.\n\n### Input Requirements:\n- Provide exactly one test input for your function\n- For functions with multiple parameters, format as a JSON array: [arg1, arg2, ...]\n- For functions with single parameter, provide the value directly\n- IMPORTANT: If your single parameter expects a list/dict, wrap it in an extra array: [[1,2,3]] or [{\"key\": \"value\"}]\n- Remember to add quotes around string arguments\n- Do NOT quote arrays/objects - input must be real JSON, not a string\n\n### Formatting:\n- Format your code with:\n```python\ndef f(...):\n    # your code here\n    return ...\n```\n- Format your input with:\n```input\narg1, arg2, ...\n```\n\n### Example Format:\n```python\ndef f(name: str, info: dict):\n    # code logic here\n    return result\n```\n\n```input\n['John', {'age': 20, 'city': 'New York'}]\n```\n\n### Input Format Examples:\n- Single parameter: \"Hello World\" or 42 or [[1, 2, 3]] (note extra brackets for lists)\n- Multiple parameters: [\"John\", {\"age\": 20}] or [5, 10, \"test\"]\n- Single parameter expecting list: [[1,2,3]] not [1,2,3]\n\n### Evaluation Criteria:\n- Executability, your code should be executable given your input\n- Difficulty in predicting your ```input``` from 1) your ```python``` code and 2) the deterministic ```output``` that will be obtained from your ```input```. Focus on either algorithmic reasoning or logic complexity. For example, you can define complex data structure classes and operate on them like trees, heaps, stacks, queues, graphs, etc, or use complex control flow, dynamic programming, recursions, divide and conquer, greedy, backtracking, etc\n- Creativity, the code needs to be sufficiently different from the provided reference snippets\n- Restricted usage of certain keywords and packages, you are not allowed to use the following words in any form, even in comments: os, sys, shutil, subprocess, pathlib, socket, requests, urllib, http, jsonpickle, pickle, marshal, ctypes, importlib, threading, multiprocessing, random, numpy, pandas, builtins, __import__, eval, exec, open, compile, globals, locals, vars, setattr, delattr, getattr\n\n### Output Format (CRITICAL):\nReturn your final answer using this exact structure:\n\n<think>your reasoning here</think>\n<answer>\n{\"program\": \"def f(x):\\n    return x\", \"input\": \"Hello World\"}\n</answer>\n\n- The <answer> block MUST contain ONLY a valid JSON object (no prose, no code fences).\n- Use double quotes for all strings; escape newlines as \\n inside string values.\n- Do NOT include the code snippet outside the JSON. Do NOT include the input outside the JSON.\n- Common mistakes to avoid: missing <answer> tags; placing Markdown fences around JSON; adding text after </answer>.\n\nFirst, carefully devise a clear plan: e.g., identify how your snippet will be challenging, distinct from reference snippets, and creative. Then, write the final code snippet and its inputs.\n\n### Reference Code Snippets:\n<snippet_0>\n```python\nclass RowNode:\n    def __init__(self, values):\n        self.values = values.copy()\n        self.skip = None\n\ndef f(matrix):\n    #

The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>. User: ## Task: Create a Python Code Snippet (where custom classes are allowed, which should be defined at the top of the code snippet) with one Matching Input\n\nUsing the reference code snippets provided below as examples, design a new and unique Python code snippet that demands deep algorithmic reasoning to deduce one possible input from a given output. Your submission should include both a code snippet and test input pair, where the input will be plugged into the code snippet to produce the output, which that function output be given to a test subject to come up with any input that will produce the same function output. This is meant to be an I.Q. test.\n\n### Code Requirements:\n- Name the entry function `f` (e.g., `def f(...): ...`), you can have nested definitions inside `f`\n- Ensure the function returns a value\n- Include at least one input parameter\n- Make the function deterministic\n- Make the snippet require state tracking across multiple data transformations, ensuring the task requires long multi step reasoning\n- AVOID THE FOLLOWING:\n  * Random functions or variables\n  * Date/time operations\n  * I/O operations (reading files, network requests)\n  * Printing or logging\n  * Any external state\n  * Import statements (NO imports allowed - use only built-in functions)\n- Ensure execution completes within 10 seconds on a modern CPU\n- Custom classes are allowed and should be defined at the very top of the code snippet\n- NO import statements of any kind - only use built-in functions like abs, len, max, min, sum, etc.\n- The snippet should end with a return statement from the main function `f`, anything after will be removed\n- All variable declarations must be inside the main function `f` or within functions `f` make calls to. Any variables declared outside of functions will be removed.\n\n### Input Requirements:\n- Provide exactly one test input for your function\n- For functions with multiple parameters, format as a JSON array: [arg1, arg2, ...]\n- For functions with single parameter, provide the value directly\n- IMPORTANT: If your single parameter expects a list/dict, wrap it in an extra array: [[1,2,3]] or [{\"key\": \"value\"}]\n- Remember to add quotes around string arguments\n- Do NOT quote arrays/objects - input must be real JSON, not a string\n\n### Formatting:\n- Format your code with: ```python\n  def f(...):\n      # your code here\n      return ...\n  ```\n- Format your input with: ```input\n  arg1, arg2, ...\n  ```\n\n### Example Format:\n```python\ndef f(name: str, info: dict):\n    # code logic here\n    return result\n```\n\n```input\n['John', {'age': 20, 'city': 'New York'}]\n```\n\n### Input Format Examples:\n- Single parameter: \"Hello World\" or 42 or [[1, 2, 3]] (note extra brackets for lists)\n- Multiple parameters: [\"John\", {\"age\": 20}] or [5, 10, \"test\"]\n- Single parameter expecting list: [[1,2,3]] not [1,2,3]\n\n### Evaluation Criteria:\n- Executability, your code should be executable given your input\n- Difficulty in predicting the output from your provided input and code snippet. Focus on either algorithmic reasoning or logic complexity. For example, you can define complex data structure classes and operate on them like trees, heaps, stacks, queues, graphs, etc, or use complex control flow, dynamic programming, recursions, divide and conquer, greedy, backtracking, etc\n- Creativity, the code needs to be sufficiently different from the provided reference snippets\n- Restricted usage of certain keywords and packages, you are not allowed to use the following words in any form, even in comments: os, sys, shutil, subprocess, pathlib, socket, requests, urllib, http, jsonpickle, pickle, marshal, ctypes, importlib, threading, multiprocessing, random, numpy, pandas, builtins, __import__, eval, exec, open, compile, globals, locals, vars, setattr, delattr, getattr\n\n### Output Format (CRITICAL):\nReturn your final answer using this exact structure:\n\n<think>your reasoning here</think>\n<answer>\n{\"program\": \"def f(x):\\n    return x\", \"input\": 123}\n</answer>\n\n- The <answer> block MUST contain ONLY a valid JSON object (no prose, no code fences).\n- Use double quotes for all strings; escape newlines as \\n inside string values.\n- Common mistakes to avoid: missing <answer> tags; placing Markdown fences around JSON; adding any extra text.\n\nFirst, carefully devise a clear plan: e.g., identify how your snippet will be challenging, distinct from reference snippets, and creative. Then, write the final code snippet and its inputs.\n\n### Reference Code Snippets:\n<snippet_0>\n```python\nclass Token:\n    def __init__(self, id, value, neighbors):\n        self.id = id\n        self.value = value\n        self.neighbors = neighbors[:]  #

The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>. User: ## Task: Create a New Python Code Snippet (where custom classes are allowed, which should be defined at the top of the code snippet) with one Matching Input\n\nUsing the reference code snippets provided below as examples, design a new and unique Python code snippet that demands deep algorithmic reasoning to deduce the output from the input. Your submission should include a code snippet and a test input pair, where the input will be plugged into the code snippet to produce the output. The input will be given to a test subject to deduce the output, which is meant to be an I.Q. test.\n\n### Code Requirements:\n- Name the entry function `f` (e.g., `def f(...): ...`), you can have nested definitions inside `f`\n- Ensure the function returns a value\n- Include at least one input parameter\n- Make the function deterministic\n- Make the snippet require state tracking across multiple data transformations, ensuring the task requires long multi step reasoning\n- AVOID THE FOLLOWING:\n  * Random functions or variables\n  * Date/time operations\n  * I/O operations (reading files, network requests)\n  * Printing or logging\n  * Any external state\n  * Import statements (NO imports allowed - use only built-in functions)\n- Ensure execution completes within 10 seconds on a modern CPU\n- Custom classes are allowed and should be defined at the very top of the code snippet\n- NO import statements of any kind - only use built-in functions like abs, len, max, min, sum, etc.\n- The snippet should end with a return statement from the main function `f`, anything after will be removed\n- All variable declarations must be inside the main function `f` or within functions `f` make calls to. Any variables declared outside of functions will be removed.\n\n### Input Requirements:\n- Provide exactly one test input for your function\n- For functions with multiple parameters, format as a JSON array: [arg1, arg2, ...]\n- For functions with single parameter, provide the value directly\n- IMPORTANT: If your single parameter expects a list/dict, wrap it in an extra array: [[1,2,3]] or [{\"key\": \"value\"}]\n- Remember to add quotes around string arguments\n- Do NOT quote arrays/objects - input must be real JSON, not a string\n\n### Formatting:\n- Format your code with:\n```python\ndef f(...):\n    # your code here\n    return ...\n```\n- Format your input with:\n```input\narg1, arg2, ...\n```\n\n### Example Format:\n```python\ndef f(name: str, info: dict):\n    # code logic here\n    return result\n```\n\n```input\n['John', {'age': 20, 'city': 'New York'}]\n```\n\n### Input Format Examples:\n- Single parameter: \"Hello World\" or 42 or [[1, 2, 3]] (note extra brackets for lists)\n- Multiple parameters: [\"John\", {\"age\": 20}] or [5, 10, \"test\"]\n- Single parameter expecting list: [[1,2,3]] not [1,2,3]\n\n### Evaluation Criteria:\n- Executability, your code should be executable given your input\n- Difficulty in predicting your ```input``` from 1) your ```python``` code and 2) the deterministic ```output``` that will be obtained from your ```input```. Focus on either algorithmic reasoning or logic complexity. For example, you can define complex data structure classes and operate on them like trees, heaps, stacks, queues, graphs, etc, or use complex control flow, dynamic programming, recursions, divide and conquer, greedy, backtracking, etc\n- Creativity, the code needs to be sufficiently different from the provided reference snippets\n- Restricted usage of certain keywords and packages, you are not allowed to use the following words in any form, even in comments: os, sys, shutil, subprocess, pathlib, socket, requests, urllib, http, jsonpickle, pickle, marshal, ctypes, importlib, threading, multiprocessing, random, numpy, pandas, builtins, __import__, eval, exec, open, compile, globals, locals, vars, setattr, delattr, getattr\n\n### Output Format (CRITICAL):\nReturn your final answer using this exact structure:\n\n<think>your reasoning here</think>\n<answer>\n{\"program\": \"def f(x):\\n    return x\", \"input\": \"Hello World\"}\n</answer>\n\n- The <answer> block MUST contain ONLY a valid JSON object (no prose, no code fences).\n- Use double quotes for all strings; escape newlines as \\n inside string values.\n- Do NOT include the code snippet outside the JSON. Do NOT include the input outside the JSON.\n- Common mistakes to avoid: missing <answer> tags; placing Markdown fences around JSON; adding text after </answer>.\n\nFirst, carefully devise a clear plan: e.g., identify how your snippet will be challenging, distinct from reference snippets, and creative. Then, write the final code snippet and its inputs.\n\n### Reference Code Snippets:\n<snippet_0>\n```python\nclass Token:\n    def __init__(self, id, value, neighbors):\n        self.id = id\n        self.value = value\n        self.neighbors = neighbors[:]  #

State will be held in node attributes and updated as the traversal proceeds.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n- Define a `SwitchNode` class with a value, adjacency list, and an 'active' flag.\n- The graph is constructed from an input dictionary.\n- There will be a set of commands to toggle nodes on/off as well as to perform computations.\n- When a node is activated, its value and edges count for future computations; when deactivated, not.\n- Traversals will sometimes use sum, sometimes product, depending on whether a node is active.\n- The function returns the final computed score after all commands.\n\n**Input Example:**\nWe'll construct a graph and a command sequence and ask for the computed output.\n\nNow, construct the code and an input:\n\n</think>\n<answer>\n{\"program\": \"class SwitchNode:\\n    def __init__(self, id, value, neighbors, active):\\n        self.id = id\\n        self.value = value\\n        self.neighbors = neighbors[:]\\n        self.active = active\\n        self.toggle_count = 0\\n\\n\\ndef f(data):\\n    nodes = {nid: SwitchNode(nid, ninfo['value'], ninfo['neighbors'], ninfo['active']) for nid, ninfo in data['nodes'].items()}\\n    \\n    def toggle_node(nid, visited):\\n        if nid in visited:\\n            return\\n        node = nodes[nid]\\n        visited.add(nid)\\n        node.active = not node.active\\n        node.toggle_count += 1\\n        # Toggling a node toggles all neighbors recursively\\n        for nb in node.neighbors:\\n            toggle_node(nb, visited)\\n\\n    def aggregate(start):\\n        # If node is active, sum its value and contiguous active neighbor values via BFS\\n        # If inactive, product of values along a simple DFS path visiting only inactive nodes, stopping on active\\n        queue = [start]\\n        seen = set()\\n        total = 0\\n        # Sum active region\\n        if nodes[start].active:\\n            while queue:\\n                curr = queue.pop(0)\\n                if curr in seen: continue\\n                seen.add(curr)\\n                node = nodes[curr]\\n                if node.active:\\n                    total += node.value\\n                    for nb in node.neighbors:\\n                        if nodes[nb].active and nb not in seen:\\n                            queue.append(nb)\\n            return total\\n        else:\\n            # DFS product for inactive region\\n            def dfs(curr, visited):\\n                visited.add(curr)\\n                node = nodes[curr]\\n                prod = node.value\\n                found = False\\n                for nb in node.neighbors:\\n                    if not nodes[nb].active and nb not in visited:\\n                        prod *= dfs(nb, visited)\\n                        found = True\\n                return prod\\n            return dfs(start, set())\\n    # Sequence of operations\\n    res = 0\\n    for cmd in data['operations']:\\n        if cmd['op'] == 'toggle':\\n            toggle_node(cmd['node'], set())\\n        elif cmd['op'] == 'aggregate':\\n            val = aggregate(cmd['node'])\\n            if cmd.get('mode') == 'add':\\n             "}

The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>. User: ## Task: Create a Python Code Snippet (where custom classes are allowed, which should be defined at the top of the code snippet) with one Matching Input\n\nUsing the reference code snippets provided below as examples, design a new and unique Python code snippet that demands deep algorithmic reasoning to deduce one possible input from a given output. Your submission should include both a code snippet and test input pair, where the input will be plugged into the code snippet to produce the output, which that function output be given to a test subject to come up with any input that will produce the same function output. This is meant to be an I.Q. test.\n\n### Code Requirements:\n- Name the entry function `f` (e.g., `def f(...): ...`), you can have nested definitions inside `f`\n- Ensure the function returns a value\n- Include at least one input parameter\n- Make the function deterministic\n- Make the snippet require state tracking across multiple data transformations, ensuring the task requires long multi step reasoning\n- AVOID THE FOLLOWING:\n  * Random functions or variables\n  * Date/time operations\n  * I/O operations (reading files, network requests)\n  * Printing or logging\n  * Any external state\n  * Import statements (NO imports allowed - use only built-in functions)\n- Ensure execution completes within 10 seconds on a modern CPU\n- Custom classes are allowed and should be defined at the very top of the code snippet\n- NO import statements of any kind - only use built-in functions like abs, len, max, min, sum, etc.\n- The snippet should end with a return statement from the main function `f`, anything after will be removed\n- All variable declarations must be inside the main function `f` or within functions `f` make calls to. Any variables declared outside of functions will be removed.\n\n### Input Requirements:\n- Provide exactly one test input for your function\n- For functions with multiple parameters, format as a JSON array: [arg1, arg2, ...]\n- For functions with single parameter, provide the value directly\n- IMPORTANT: If your single parameter expects a list/dict, wrap it in an extra array: [[1,2,3]] or [{\"key\": \"value\"}]\n- Remember to add quotes around string arguments\n- Do NOT quote arrays/objects - input must be real JSON, not a string\n\n### Formatting:\n- Format your code with: ```python\n  def f(...):\n      # your code here\n      return ...\n  ```\n- Format your input with: ```input\n  arg1, arg2, ...\n  ```\n\n### Example Format:\n```python\ndef f(name: str, info: dict):\n    # code logic here\n    return result\n```\n\n```input\n['John', {'age': 20, 'city': 'New York'}]\n```\n\n### Input Format Examples:\n- Single parameter: \"Hello World\" or 42 or [[1, 2, 3]] (note extra brackets for lists)\n- Multiple parameters: [\"John\", {\"age\": 20}] or [5, 10, \"test\"]\n- Single parameter expecting list: [[1,2,3]] not [1,2,3]\n\n### Evaluation Criteria:\n- Executability, your code should be executable given your input\n- Difficulty in predicting the output from your provided input and code snippet. Focus on either algorithmic reasoning or logic complexity. For example, you can define complex data structure classes and operate on them like trees, heaps, stacks, queues, graphs, etc, or use complex control flow, dynamic programming, recursions, divide and conquer, greedy, backtracking, etc\n- Creativity, the code needs to be sufficiently different from the provided reference snippets\n- Restricted usage of certain keywords and packages, you are not allowed to use the following words in any form, even in comments: os, sys, shutil, subprocess, pathlib, socket, requests, urllib, http, jsonpickle, pickle, marshal, ctypes, importlib, threading, multiprocessing, random, numpy, pandas, builtins, __import__, eval, exec, open, compile, globals, locals, vars, setattr, delattr, getattr\n\n### Output Format (CRITICAL):\nReturn your final answer using this exact structure:\n\n<think>your reasoning here</think>\n<answer>\n{\"program\": \"def f(x):\\n    return x\", \"input\": 123}\n</answer>\n\n- The <answer> block MUST contain ONLY a valid JSON object (no prose, no code fences).\n- Use double quotes for all strings; escape newlines as \\n inside string values.\n- Common mistakes to avoid: missing <answer> tags; placing Markdown fences around JSON; adding any extra text.\n\nFirst, carefully devise a clear plan: e.g., identify how your snippet will be challenging, distinct from reference snippets, and creative. Then, write the final code snippet and its inputs.\n\n### Reference Code Snippets:\n<snippet_0>\n```python\nclass Token:\n    def __init__(self, id, value, neighbors):\n        self.id = id\n        self.value = value\n        self.neighbors = neighbors[:]  #

At the end, return the sum of (value * visited count) of all nodes.\n\nState must be managed carefully, and the propagation will be mutated by earlier increments and propagate actions.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```python\nclass DAGNode:\n    def __init__(self, id, val):\n        self.id = id\n        self.val = val\n        self.children = []\n        self.visited = 0\n\ndef f(desc):\n    nodes = {nid: DAGNode(nid, ninfo['val']) for nid, ninfo in desc['nodes'].items()}\n    for nid, ninfo in desc['nodes'].items():\n        node = nodes[nid]\n        for cid in ninfo.get('children', []):\n            node.children.append(nodes[cid])\n    for op in desc['ops']:\n        if op['type'] == 'inc':\n            nodes[op['target']].val += op['amount']\n        elif op['type'] == 'propagate':\n            def propagate(node, pv):\n                node.val += pv\n                node.visited += 1\n                for child in node.children:\n                    propagate(child, node.val)\n            propagate(nodes[op['target']], 0)\n    return sum(n.val * n.visited for n in nodes.values())\n```\n\nNow, for the input: I need to think about a compact DAG, with an op sequence that transforms values and visits in an interesting manner.\n\nSuppose a structure like this:\n\n- A (root), value=2, children: B,C\n- B, value=1, children: D\n- C, value=0, children: D\n- D, value=3, children: none\n\nOp sequence:\n- inc A by 1 -> A=3\n- propagate from B: B gets +0 (pv=0), B.visited+=1; B's child D gets +B.val=1, D.visited+=1, D.value now 3+1=4\n- propagate from A: A gets +0 (pv=0), A.visited+=1; B gets +A.val=3, B.visited+=1, B.value now 2+3+1(prev)=6; D gets propagated from B with +B.val=6, D.visited+=1 (so now visited=2), D.value now 4+6=10. C gets +A.val=3, C.visited+=1, C.value now 0+3=3; C propagates to D with +C.val=3, D.visited+=1 (now 3), D.value=10+3=13\n\nLet's see final state:\n\n- A: val=3, visited=1\n- B: val=6, visited=2\n- C: val=3, visited=1\n- D: val=13, visited=3\n\nReturn sum(val*visited):\n\n- A: 3*1=3\n- B: 6*2=12\n- C: 3*1=3\n- D:13*3=39\n\nTotal: 3+12+3+39=57\n\nSo, the code and input are:\n\nprogram string: (making sure to preserve indentation and escapes for newlines)\n\ninput:\n{\n  \"nodes\": {\n    \"A\": {\"val\": 2, \"children\": [\"B\", \"C\"]},\n    \"B\": {\"val\": 1, \"children\": [\"D\"]},\n    \"C\": {\"val\": 0, \"children\": [\"D\"]},\n    \"D\": {\"val\": 3}\n  },\n  \"ops\": [\n    {\"type\": \"inc\", \"target\": \"A\", \"amount\": 1},\n    {\"type\": \"propagate\", \"target\": \"B\"},\n    {\"type\": \"propagate\", \"target\": \"A\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nSo input for the system is a JSON array with one dict.\n</think>\n<answer>\n{\"program\": \"class DAGNode:\\n    def __init__(self, id, val):\\n        self.id = id\\n        self.val = val\\n        self.children = []\\n        self.visited = 0\\n\\ndef f(desc):\\n    nodes = {nid: DAGNode(nid, ninfo['val']) for nid, ninfo in desc['nodes'].items()}\\n    for nid, ninfo in desc['nodes'].items():\\n        node = nodes[nid]\\n        for cid in ninfo.get('children', []):\\n            node.children.append(nodes[cid])\\n    for op in desc['ops']:\\n        if op['type'] == 'inc':\\n            nodes[op['target']].val += op['amount']\\n        elif op['type'] == 'propagate':\\n            def propagate(node, pv):\\n                node.val += pv\\n                node.visited"}

The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>. User: ## Task: Create a New Python Code Snippet (where custom classes are allowed, which should be defined at the top of the code snippet) with one Matching Input\n\nUsing the reference code snippets provided below as examples, design a new and unique Python code snippet that demands deep algorithmic reasoning to deduce the output from the input. Your submission should include a code snippet and a test input pair, where the input will be plugged into the code snippet to produce the output. The input will be given to a test subject to deduce the output, which is meant to be an I.Q. test.\n\n### Code Requirements:\n- Name the entry function `f` (e.g., `def f(...): ...`), you can have nested definitions inside `f`\n- Ensure the function returns a value\n- Include at least one input parameter\n- Make the function deterministic\n- Make the snippet require state tracking across multiple data transformations, ensuring the task requires long multi step reasoning\n- AVOID THE FOLLOWING:\n  * Random functions or variables\n  * Date/time operations\n  * I/O operations (reading files, network requests)\n  * Printing or logging\n  * Any external state\n  * Import statements (NO imports allowed - use only built-in functions)\n- Ensure execution completes within 10 seconds on a modern CPU\n- Custom classes are allowed and should be defined at the very top of the code snippet\n- NO import statements of any kind - only use built-in functions like abs, len, max, min, sum, etc.\n- The snippet should end with a return statement from the main function `f`, anything after will be removed\n- All variable declarations must be inside the main function `f` or within functions `f` make calls to. Any variables declared outside of functions will be removed.\n\n### Input Requirements:\n- Provide exactly one test input for your function\n- For functions with multiple parameters, format as a JSON array: [arg1, arg2, ...]\n- For functions with single parameter, provide the value directly\n- IMPORTANT: If your single parameter expects a list/dict, wrap it in an extra array: [[1,2,3]] or [{\"key\": \"value\"}]\n- Remember to add quotes around string arguments\n- Do NOT quote arrays/objects - input must be real JSON, not a string\n\n### Formatting:\n- Format your code with:\n```python\ndef f(...):\n    # your code here\n    return ...\n```\n- Format your input with:\n```input\narg1, arg2, ...\n```\n\n### Example Format:\n```python\ndef f(name: str, info: dict):\n    # code logic here\n    return result\n```\n\n```input\n['John', {'age': 20, 'city': 'New York'}]\n```\n\n### Input Format Examples:\n- Single parameter: \"Hello World\" or 42 or [[1, 2, 3]] (note extra brackets for lists)\n- Multiple parameters: [\"John\", {\"age\": 20}] or [5, 10, \"test\"]\n- Single parameter expecting list: [[1,2,3]] not [1,2,3]\n\n### Evaluation Criteria:\n- Executability, your code should be executable given your input\n- Difficulty in predicting your ```input``` from 1) your ```python``` code and 2) the deterministic ```output``` that will be obtained from your ```input```. Focus on either algorithmic reasoning or logic complexity. For example, you can define complex data structure classes and operate on them like trees, heaps, stacks, queues, graphs, etc, or use complex control flow, dynamic programming, recursions, divide and conquer, greedy, backtracking, etc\n- Creativity, the code needs to be sufficiently different from the provided reference snippets\n- Restricted usage of certain keywords and packages, you are not allowed to use the following words in any form, even in comments: os, sys, shutil, subprocess, pathlib, socket, requests, urllib, http, jsonpickle, pickle, marshal, ctypes, importlib, threading, multiprocessing, random, numpy, pandas, builtins, __import__, eval, exec, open, compile, globals, locals, vars, setattr, delattr, getattr\n\n### Output Format (CRITICAL):\nReturn your final answer using this exact structure:\n\n<think>your reasoning here</think>\n<answer>\n{\"program\": \"def f(x):\\n    return x\", \"input\": \"Hello World\"}\n</answer>\n\n- The <answer> block MUST contain ONLY a valid JSON object (no prose, no code fences).\n- Use double quotes for all strings; escape newlines as \\n inside string values.\n- Do NOT include the code snippet outside the JSON. Do NOT include the input outside the JSON.\n- Common mistakes to avoid: missing <answer> tags; placing Markdown fences around JSON; adding text after </answer>.\n\nFirst, carefully devise a clear plan: e.g., identify how your snippet will be challenging, distinct from reference snippets, and creative. Then, write the final code snippet and its inputs.\n\n### Reference Code Snippets:\n<snippet_0>\n```python\nclass DAGNode:\n    def __init__(self, id, val):\n        self.id = id\n        self.val = val\n        self.children = []\n        self.visited = 0\n\ndef f(desc):\n    nodes = {nid: DAGNode(nid, ninfo['val']) for nid, ninfo in desc['nodes'].items()}\n    for nid, ninfo in desc['nodes'].items():\n        node = nodes[nid]\n        for cid in ninfo.get('children', []):\n            node.children.append(nodes[cid])\n    for op in desc['ops']:\n        if op['type'] == 'inc':\n            nodes[op['target']].val += op['amount']\n        elif op['type'] == 'propagate':\n            def propagate(node, pv):\n                node.val += pv\n                node.visited += 1\n                for child in node.children:\n                    propagate(child, node.val)\n            propagate(nodes[op['target']], 0)\n    return sum(n.val * n.visited for n in nodes.values())\n```\n```input\n[{'nodes': {'A': {'val': 2, 'children': ['B', 'C']}, 'B': {'val': 1, 'children': ['D']}, 'C': {'val': 0, 'children': ['D']}, 'D': {'val': 3}}, 'ops': [{'type': 'inc', 'target': 'A', 'amount': 1}, {'type': 'propagate', 'target': 'B'}, {'type': 'propagate', 'target': 'A'}]}]\n```\n```output\n47\n```\n</snippet_0>\n<snippet_1>\n```python\nclass Token:\n    def __init__(self, id, value, neighbors):\n        self.id = id\n        self.value = value\n        self.neighbors = neighbors[:]  #

The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>. User: ## Task: Create a Python Code Snippet (where custom classes are allowed, which should be defined at the top of the code snippet) with one Matching Input\n\nUsing the reference code snippets provided below as examples, design a new and unique Python code snippet that demands deep algorithmic reasoning to deduce one possible input from a given output. Your submission should include both a code snippet and test input pair, where the input will be plugged into the code snippet to produce the output, which that function output be given to a test subject to come up with any input that will produce the same function output. This is meant to be an I.Q. test.\n\n### Code Requirements:\n- Name the entry function `f` (e.g., `def f(...): ...`), you can have nested definitions inside `f`\n- Ensure the function returns a value\n- Include at least one input parameter\n- Make the function deterministic\n- Make the snippet require state tracking across multiple data transformations, ensuring the task requires long multi step reasoning\n- AVOID THE FOLLOWING:\n  * Random functions or variables\n  * Date/time operations\n  * I/O operations (reading files, network requests)\n  * Printing or logging\n  * Any external state\n  * Import statements (NO imports allowed - use only built-in functions)\n- Ensure execution completes within 10 seconds on a modern CPU\n- Custom classes are allowed and should be defined at the very top of the code snippet\n- NO import statements of any kind - only use built-in functions like abs, len, max, min, sum, etc.\n- The snippet should end with a return statement from the main function `f`, anything after will be removed\n- All variable declarations must be inside the main function `f` or within functions `f` make calls to. Any variables declared outside of functions will be removed.\n\n### Input Requirements:\n- Provide exactly one test input for your function\n- For functions with multiple parameters, format as a JSON array: [arg1, arg2, ...]\n- For functions with single parameter, provide the value directly\n- IMPORTANT: If your single parameter expects a list/dict, wrap it in an extra array: [[1,2,3]] or [{\"key\": \"value\"}]\n- Remember to add quotes around string arguments\n- Do NOT quote arrays/objects - input must be real JSON, not a string\n\n### Formatting:\n- Format your code with: ```python\n  def f(...):\n      # your code here\n      return ...\n  ```\n- Format your input with: ```input\n  arg1, arg2, ...\n  ```\n\n### Example Format:\n```python\ndef f(name: str, info: dict):\n    # code logic here\n    return result\n```\n\n```input\n['John', {'age': 20, 'city': 'New York'}]\n```\n\n### Input Format Examples:\n- Single parameter: \"Hello World\" or 42 or [[1, 2, 3]] (note extra brackets for lists)\n- Multiple parameters: [\"John\", {\"age\": 20}] or [5, 10, \"test\"]\n- Single parameter expecting list: [[1,2,3]] not [1,2,3]\n\n### Evaluation Criteria:\n- Executability, your code should be executable given your input\n- Difficulty in predicting the output from your provided input and code snippet. Focus on either algorithmic reasoning or logic complexity. For example, you can define complex data structure classes and operate on them like trees, heaps, stacks, queues, graphs, etc, or use complex control flow, dynamic programming, recursions, divide and conquer, greedy, backtracking, etc\n- Creativity, the code needs to be sufficiently different from the provided reference snippets\n- Restricted usage of certain keywords and packages, you are not allowed to use the following words in any form, even in comments: os, sys, shutil, subprocess, pathlib, socket, requests, urllib, http, jsonpickle, pickle, marshal, ctypes, importlib, threading, multiprocessing, random, numpy, pandas, builtins, __import__, eval, exec, open, compile, globals, locals, vars, setattr, delattr, getattr\n\n### Output Format (CRITICAL):\nReturn your final answer using this exact structure:\n\n<think>your reasoning here</think>\n<answer>\n{\"program\": \"def f(x):\\n    return x\", \"input\": 123}\n</answer>\n\n- The <answer> block MUST contain ONLY a valid JSON object (no prose, no code fences).\n- Use double quotes for all strings; escape newlines as \\n inside string values.\n- Common mistakes to avoid: missing <answer> tags; placing Markdown fences around JSON; adding any extra text.\n\nFirst, carefully devise a clear plan: e.g., identify how your snippet will be challenging, distinct from reference snippets, and creative. Then, write the final code snippet and its inputs.\n\n### Reference Code Snippets:\n<snippet_0>\n```python\nclass DAGNode:\n    def __init__(self, id, val):\n        self.id = id\n        self.val = val\n        self.children = []\n        self.visited = 0\n\ndef f(desc):\n    nodes = {nid: DAGNode(nid, ninfo['val']) for nid, ninfo in desc['nodes'].items()}\n    for nid, ninfo in desc['nodes'].items():\n        node = nodes[nid]\n        for cid in ninfo.get('children', []):\n            node.children.append(nodes[cid])\n    for op in desc['ops']:\n        if op['type'] == 'inc':\n            nodes[op['target']].val += op['amount']\n        elif op['type'] == 'propagate':\n            def propagate(node, pv):\n                node.val += pv\n                node.visited += 1\n                for child in node.children:\n                    propagate(child, node.val)\n            propagate(nodes[op['target']], 0)\n    return sum(n.val * n.visited for n in nodes.values())\n```\n```input\n[{'nodes': {'A': {'val': 2, 'children': ['B', 'C']}, 'B': {'val': 1, 'children': ['D']}, 'C': {'val': 0, 'children': ['D']}, 'D': {'val': 3}}, 'ops': [{'type': 'inc', 'target': 'A', 'amount': 1}, {'type': 'propagate', 'target': 'B'}, {'type': 'propagate', 'target': 'A'}]}]\n```\n```output\n47\n```\n</snippet_0>\n<snippet_1>\n```python\nclass Token:\n    def __init__(self, id, value, neighbors):\n        self.id = id\n        self.value = value\n        self.neighbors = neighbors[:]  #

Your submission should include a code snippet and a test input pair, where the input will be plugged into the code snippet to produce the output. The input will be given to a test subject to deduce the output, which is meant to be an I.Q. test.\n\n### Code Requirements:\n- Name the entry function `f` (e.g., `def f(...): ...`), you can have nested definitions inside `f`\n- Ensure the function returns a value\n- Include at least one input parameter\n- Make the function deterministic\n- Make the snippet require state tracking across multiple data transformations, ensuring the task requires long multi step reasoning\n- AVOID THE FOLLOWING:\n  * Random functions or variables\n  * Date/time operations\n  * I/O operations (reading files, network requests)\n  * Printing or logging\n  * Any external state\n  * Import statements (NO imports allowed - use only built-in functions)\n- Ensure execution completes within 10 seconds on a modern CPU\n- Custom classes are allowed and should be defined at the very top of the code snippet\n- NO import statements of any kind - only use built-in functions like abs, len, max, min, sum, etc.\n- The snippet should end with a return statement from the main function `f`, anything after will be removed\n- All variable declarations must be inside the main function `f` or within functions `f` make calls to. Any variables declared outside of functions will be removed.\n\n### Input Requirements:\n- Provide exactly one test input for your function\n- For functions with multiple parameters, format as a JSON array: [arg1, arg2, ...]\n- For functions with single parameter, provide the value directly\n- IMPORTANT: If your single parameter expects a list/dict, wrap it in an extra array: [[1,2,3]] or [{\"key\": \"value\"}]\n- Remember to add quotes around string arguments\n- Do NOT quote arrays/objects - input must be real JSON, not a string\n\n### Formatting:\n- Format your code with:\n```python\ndef f(...):\n    # your code here\n    return ...\n```\n- Format your input with:\n```input\narg1, arg2, ...\n```\n\n### Example Format:\n```python\ndef f(name: str, info: dict):\n    # code logic here\n    return result\n```\n\n```input\n['John', {'age': 20, 'city': 'New York'}]\n```\n\n### Input Format Examples:\n- Single parameter: \"Hello World\" or 42 or [[1, 2, 3]] (note extra brackets for lists)\n- Multiple parameters: [\"John\", {\"age\": 20}] or [5, 10, \"test\"]\n- Single parameter expecting list: [[1,2,3]] not [1,2,3]\n\n### Evaluation Criteria:\n- Executability, your code should be executable given your input\n- Difficulty in predicting your ```input``` from 1) your ```python``` code and 2) the deterministic ```output``` that will be obtained from your ```input```. Focus on either algorithmic reasoning or logic complexity. For example, you can define complex data structure classes and operate on them like trees, heaps, stacks, queues, graphs, etc, or use complex control flow, dynamic programming, recursions, divide and conquer, greedy, backtracking, etc\n- Creativity, the code needs to be sufficiently different from the provided reference snippets\n- Restricted usage of certain keywords and packages, you are not allowed to use the following words in any form, even in comments: os, sys, shutil, subprocess, pathlib, socket, requests, urllib, http, jsonpickle, pickle, marshal, ctypes, importlib, threading, multiprocessing, random, numpy, pandas, builtins, __import__, eval, exec, open, compile, globals, locals, vars, setattr, delattr, getattr\n\n### Output Format (CRITICAL):\nReturn your final answer using this exact structure:\n\n<think>your reasoning here</think>\n<answer>\n{\"program\": \"def f(x):\\n    return x\", \"input\": \"Hello World\"}\n</answer>\n\n- The <answer> block MUST contain ONLY a valid JSON object (no prose, no code fences).\n- Use double quotes for all strings; escape newlines as \\n inside string values.\n- Do NOT include the code snippet outside the JSON. Do NOT include the input outside the JSON.\n- Common mistakes to avoid: missing <answer> tags; placing Markdown fences around JSON; adding text after </answer>.\n\nFirst, carefully devise a clear plan: e.g., identify how your snippet will be challenging, distinct from reference snippets, and creative. Then, write the final code snippet and its inputs.\n\n### Reference Code Snippets:\n<snippet_0>\n```python\ndef f(x):\n    return x\n```\n```input\nHello World\n```\n```output\nHello World\n```\n</snippet_0>\n\nAssistant: <think>"}], "info": {"K": 6, "mc_samples": 8, "determinism_runs": 2, "oai_tools": null}}

Effectively, overall for the root node, the function returns:\n- For each node N: N.val - sum( values of N's immediate children )\n- sum over all nodes in the tree.\nBut, as you traverse, you process each node. So the sum is (node.value - sum of values of immediate children) for each node, summed up.\n\nIf you expand, say, for the whole tree:\nLet S = sum over all nodes of (node.val - sum(children.vals))\nBut, sum(sum(children.vals) over all nodes) = sum(node.vals) over all nodes except the root, because each node except root is a child exactly once.\nSo, total output = sum(root.val + sum(values of all nodes except root) - sum(values of all children for each node))\nThis telescopes to: the root value only.\n\nBut let's check a small example:\nE.g. for [10]:\nroot is 10, no children: \n10 - 0 = 10. Done.\n\nE.g. for [10, [3], [2]]:\nroot 10, children 3, 2.\nroot: 10 - (3+2) = 5, process(3)=3, process(2)=2. total: 5+3+2=10.\n\nAnother test, with a child having its own child:\n[10, [3, [2]]]\nRoot: 10 - 3 = 7\nprocess(3,[2]): 3-2=1, process(2)=2; overall: 1+2=3\ntotal: 7+3=10\n\nThis will always sum up to the root node value, regardless of tree shape.\n\nStep 3: Plan for input design\n- All inputs, regardless of shape, will return the root node value.

You can also leave a message to the test subject to help them deduce the code snippet.\n\n### Input Requirements:\n- Provide 6 valid inputs for the code snippet\n- For each input, format multiple arguments with commas between them\n- Remember to add quotes around string arguments\n- Each input should be individually wrapped in ```input``` tags\n\n### Message Requirements:\n- Leave a message to the test subject to help them deduce the code snippet\n- The message should be wrapped in ```message``` tags\n- The message can be in any form, can even be formed into a coding question, or a natural language instruction what the code snippet does\n- You cannot provide the code snippet in the message\n\n### Formatting:\n- Format your input with:\n```input\narg1, arg2, ...\n```\n\n### Example Format:\n```input\n'John', {'age': 20, 'city': 'New York'}\n```\n```input\n'Sammy', {'age': 37, 'city': 'Los Angeles'}\n```\n\n### Evaluation Criteria:\n- Executability, your code should be executable given your inputs\n- Coverage, the inputs and outputs should cover the whole input space of the code snippet, able to deduce the code snippet from the inputs and outputs\n- Creativity, the inputs need to be sufficiently different from each other\n- The overall selection of inputs and message combined should be challenging for the test subject, but not impossible for them to solve\nFirst, carefully devise a clear plan: e.g., understand the code snippet, then identify how your proposed inputs have high coverage, and why the inputs will be challenging and creative. Then, write the inputs and message. Remember to wrap your inputs in ```input``` tags, and your message in ```message``` tags.\n\n### Code Snippet:\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, val):\n        self.val = val\n        self.children = []\n\ndef f(tree_list):\n    def build(node_list):\n        node = Node(node_list[0])\n        for child in node_list[1:]:\n            node.children.append(build(child))\n        return node\n    def process(node):\n        # difference between node.val and sum of direct children's values\n        child_sum = sum(child.val for child in node.children)\n        total = node.val - child_sum\n        for child in node.children:\n            total += process(child)\n        return total\n    root = build(tree_list)\n    return process(root)\nf(<|YOUR INPUT WILL BE PLUGGED HERE|>)\n```\n\n### Output Format (CRITICAL):\nReturn your final answer using this exact structure:\n\n<think>your reasoning here</think>\n<answer>\n{\"message\": \"short helpful hint\", \"inputs\": [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\"]}\n</answer>\n\n- The <answer> block MUST contain ONLY a valid JSON object with keys: message (string) and inputs (list).\n- Each input must be a valid Python literal matching the snippet\u2019s argument signature.\n- Do NOT wrap JSON in Markdown fences; do NOT add any text outside the tags.\nAssistant: <think>"}], "info": {"K": 6, "mc_samples": 8, "determinism_runs": 2}}
