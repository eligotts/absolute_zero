Implement a method to add intervals but when adding a new number:\n   - it attempts to merge with overlapping or adjacent intervals,\n   - it also applies a transformation on overlapping intervals to lengthen them by their start value modulated by some function.\n3. The function f will take a list of integers, add them one by one to this IntervalSet.\n4. After processing all integers, the function will compute a complex metric involving the sum of product of the intervals start values with the sum of all multiples of the length parameter through recursive logic.\n5.
